/**
 * A reusable synchronization barrier, similar in functionality to
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier CyclicBarrier} and
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch CountDownLatch}
 * but supporting more flexible usage.
 *
 * <p><b>Registration.</b> Unlike the case for other barriers, the
 * number of parties <em>registered</em> to synchronize on a phaser
 * may vary over time.  Tasks may be registered at any time (using
 * methods {@link #register}, {@link #bulkRegister}, or forms of
 * constructors establishing initial numbers of parties), and
 * optionally deregistered upon any arrival (using {@link
 * #arriveAndDeregister}).  As is the case with most basic
 * synchronization constructs, registration and deregistration affect
 * only internal counts; they do not establish any further internal
 * bookkeeping, so tasks cannot query whether they are registered.
 * (However, you can introduce such bookkeeping by subclassing this
 * class.)
 *
 * <p><b>Synchronization.</b> Like a {@code CyclicBarrier}, a {@code
 * Phaser} may be repeatedly awaited.  Method {@link
 * #arriveAndAwaitAdvance} has effect analogous to {@link
 * java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier#await CyclicBarrier.await}. Each
 * generation of a phaser has an associated phase number. The phase
 * number starts at zero, and advances when all parties arrive at the
 * phaser, wrapping around to zero after reaching {@code
 * Integer.MAX_VALUE}. The use of phase numbers enables independent
 * control of actions upon arrival at a phaser and upon awaiting
 * others, via two kinds of methods that may be invoked by any
 * registered party:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *   <li><b>Arrival.</b> Methods {@link #arrive} and
 *       {@link #arriveAndDeregister} record arrival.  These methods
 *       do not block, but return an associated <em>arrival phase
 *       number</em>; that is, the phase number of the phaser to which
 *       the arrival applied. When the final party for a given phase
 *       arrives, an optional action is performed and the phase
 *       advances.  These actions are performed by the party
 *       triggering a phase advance, and are arranged by overriding
 *       method {@link #onAdvance(int, int)}, which also controls
 *       termination. Overriding this method is similar to, but more
 *       flexible than, providing a barrier action to a {@code
 *       CyclicBarrier}.
 *
 *   <li><b>Waiting.</b> Method {@link #awaitAdvance} requires an
 *       argument indicating an arrival phase number, and returns when
 *       the phaser advances to (or is already at) a different phase.
 *       Unlike similar constructions using {@code CyclicBarrier},
 *       method {@code awaitAdvance} continues to wait even if the
 *       waiting thread is interrupted. Interruptible and timeout
 *       versions are also available, but exceptions encountered while
 *       tasks wait interruptibly or with timeout do not change the
 *       state of the phaser. If necessary, you can perform any
 *       associated recovery within handlers of those exceptions,
 *       often after invoking {@code forceTermination}.  Phasers may
 *       also be used by tasks executing in a {@link ForkJoinPool}.
 *       Progress is ensured if the pool's parallelismLevel can
 *       accommodate the maximum number of simultaneously blocked
 *       parties.
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Termination.</b> A phaser may enter a <em>termination</em>
 * state, that may be checked using method {@link #isTerminated}. Upon
 * termination, all synchronization methods immediately return without
 * waiting for advance,
